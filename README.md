# Preprocessing for Group Discovery

We are given a user dataset *D* where each line has the following schema *<u, i>* which means that the item *i* is associated to the user *u*. The dataset *D* should be transformed to an ideal input for the group discovery algorithm. For this aim, we execute the Python script `pmr.py` above.

The script gets as input the dataset *D* in form of <user,item,rating>. It returns a text file `pmr.txt` (abbr. pattern mining ready).
